# a-proper-test-launcher

Have a pre-existing build system?
Or a pre-existing way of running tests in the browser?

_But don't have a way to run tests from the CLI in any browser? (especially for CI?)_

This is *the* tool for you. 
A no fuss test-launcher, supporting any browser on your system. 
No need to download copies of browsers or drivers for browsers, like puppeteer or playwright.

## Install

## Setup 

## Supported test frameworks

### QUnit


### Custom

## Supported servers / bundlers

All of them.

This tool has two modes:
 1. point at an existing host / port 
 2. serve static files and go-to 1.
